# Sedliak II: Cesta k ešte väčšiemu psychu

A classic Slovak game for MS DOS, in which you chat with a psychiatrist. (Available only in Slovak.)

## Introduction

Did you know that talking to a psychiatrist could be quite enjoyable? PUDr. Michal Kacabaya, also known as Kacn, is really weird: Although you would probably not want to consult him even if you desperately need the help of a psychiatrist, talking to him is nevertheless a, shall we say, interesting experience. In this game, you can chat with him - maybe he will cure you! Alternatively, you can be PUDr. Kacn yourself, and try to help patients who come in seeking your 'expert' advice.
